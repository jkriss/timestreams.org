    <h2>File format</h2>
    <p>
      Complying with the protocol described previously is sufficient to implement
      a Time Streams server. In addition, there is a Time Streams Day Archive
      file format that is useful for file-based servers, or as a standard for
      importing and exporting full archives. (The
      <a href="https://github.com/jkriss/time-streams">node.js implementation</a>
      uses this as its on-disk storage format.)
    </p>

    <h3>Directory structure</h3>

    <p>
      The directory for a stream has a <code>.timestream</code> suffix. For example, a
      stream called <code>statuses</code> would exist at <code>statuses.timestream</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Posts are organized in directories following the <code>YYYY/MM/DD</code> format
      based on the UTC day of the post.
    </p>

    <h3>File names</h3>

    <p>
      Post files have a name and an optional time prefix, delimited by a <code>-</code>
      character, and a file extension representing the content type. The time is
      an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601</a>
      time fragment in UTC time formatted <code>HHmmssZ</code>, without punctuation (the "basic" form).
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, a text post generated at Wed, 24 Jun 2020 05:12:53 GMT with the name
      <code>hi</code> would be stored at <code>2020/06/24/051253Z-hi.txt</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If no time is present in the filename, the day fragment will be the only
      time information. The server should sort first by time, and then lexicographic order.
      Time stream data stores should generate a post name if none is provided.
    </p>

    <p>
      In combination, these rules lend themselves well to managing day-resolution
      streams by hand. For instance, if you have a blog stored as a time stream,
      you could structure it like this:
    </p>

<pre>blog.timestream/
   2020/
     06/
        23/
           01-first-post.md
           02-second-post-on-the-first-day.md
        24/
           01-third-post.md
</pre>

    <p>
      On the other end of the spectrum, if it's possible that multiple files
      are generated per second, and the ordering within a single second is meaningful,
      then the store should generate names that sort properly. (<a href="https://github.com/ulid/spec"
      target="_blank">ulid</a> is a nice example of a name generation technique with the desired properties.)
    </p>

    <p>
      In that case, the directory structure might look something like this:
    </p>

<pre>posts.timestream/
2020/
 06/
    24/
       051121Z-01EBJBSPBA3BAMAHS9RQDDK83G.txt
       051121Z-01EBJBSPBA3BAMAHS9RQDDK83H.txt
       051121Z-01EBJBSPBA3BAMAHS9RQDDK83I.txt
</pre>
