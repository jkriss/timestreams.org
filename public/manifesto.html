    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Social media platforms aren't serving us well.</strong> As our lives become more digital, our very lives are constrained by these mediated platforms. We need digital tools that are better mapped to both the expression and goals of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>One feed per user per app is an insufficient model.</strong> We are more complex and multifaceted than that, and it's not just about who can see which posts. We shouldn't have to create multiple accounts to express ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>We need our own personal archives and libraries</strong> as much as we need our sharing channels. We're missing out on the digital equivalent of our journals and our recipe books. We're missing reflection, we're missing things we used to pass down through our families.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>We need simpler building blocks.</strong> We can't—and shouldn't—build clones of multi-billion dollar platforms using tools optimized for teams of full time, professional software developers. We need a different way to build what we need, an approach that's compatible with hobbyist time and skills, and that can meet community and individual needs without requiring capital or market logic.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
      We do this not by trying to create a new blank slate utopia, but by building creatively with the pieces the world already has for us, by choosing approaches that align with our goals and values, and by valuing approaches, patterns, and protocols over particular platforms or code.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yes, some of the tools from our digital past solved or avoided some of these problems. Some of us used to have our own websites, and our own blogs and RSS feeds. The world has moved on, though, and we can't solve the problems and needs of today with nostalgia alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what do we do?
