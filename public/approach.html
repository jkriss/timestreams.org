    <h2>Approach</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>We want something simple.</strong> It should be both easy to
      understand, and relatively easy to implement.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>We want to invent as little as possible.</strong> We have well
      understood, well adopted, and well supported tools that can do nearly
      all of what we need.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
      The Time Streams protocol uses HTTP, three HTTP headers, and
      one optional query string parameter. There are no new formats, data types,
      or custom schemas. It can be implemented as an enhancement on top of a
      standard HTTP server.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fetching a single post is a regular HTTP call. The javascript client for
      fetching multiple posts in a stream is well under 1KB minified and gzipped,
      and it contains some fancy features.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is running on such a server. The examples you see are live Time
      Stream responses.
