    <h2>Time Streams Day Archive Format</h2>
    <p>
      Complying with the Time Streams protocol is sufficient to implement
      a compatible server. In addition, there is a Time Streams Day Archive
      file format that is useful for file-based servers, or as a standard for
      importing and exporting archives.
    </p>
    <p>The
      <a href="https://github.com/jkriss/time-streams">node.js implementation</a>
      uses this as its on-disk storage format, and converters exist for
      <a href="https://github.com/jkriss/instagram-time-streams" target="_blank">Instagram</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/jkriss/pinboard-time-streams" target="_blank">Pinboard</a>,
      and <a href="https://github.com/jkriss/notabli-time-streams" target="_blank">Notabli</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Directory structure</h3>

    <p>
      The directory for a stream has a <code>.timestream</code> suffix. For example, a
      stream called <code>statuses</code> would exist at <code>statuses.timestream</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Posts are organized in directories following the <code>YYYY/MM/DD</code> format
      based on the UTC day of the post.
    </p>

    <h3>File names</h3>

    <p>
      Post files have a name and an optional time prefix, delimited by a <code>-</code>
      character, and a file extension representing the content type. The time is
      an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601</a>
      time fragment in UTC time formatted <code>HHmmssZ</code>, without punctuation (the "basic" form).
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, a text post generated at Wed, 24 Jun 2020 05:12:53 GMT with the name
      <code>hi</code> would be stored at <code>2020/06/24/051253Z-hi.txt</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If no time is present in the filename, the time fragment is assumed to be
      <code>000000Z</code>. The store should sort first by time, and then lexicographic order.
      Time Stream data stores should generate a post name if none is provided.
    </p>

    <h3>Related files</h3>

    <p>
      Related files are stored with the format<code>[main post id]$[relation].[ext]</code>.
      That is, a metadata file describing <code>01-first-post.md</code> could be stored at
      <code>01-first-post.md$describedby.json</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Related files should not be returned in regular <code>previous</code>-style traversal
      or by <code>before</code> date queries. They should be surfaced via <code>Link</code>
      headers on the primary post, and can be fetched directly by id.
    </p>

    <h3>Attributes</h3>

    <p>
      Additional attributes for any given post or related file are stored in a <code>.attributes</code>
      file, with a string matching the attributes portion of a <code>Link</code> header entry. For the
      post itself, the suffix <code>$self.attributes</code> is used.
    </p>
    <p>For example, an image file stored at
      <code>2020/07/20/my-photo.jpg</code> could have a corresponding <code>2020/07/20/my-photo.jpg$self.attributes</code>
      file with content <code>title="San Francisco cityscape with a view of Sutro Tower"</code>.
      When fetched via HTTP, the response would have a link header containing
      <code>&lt;post-id&gt;; rel=self, title="San Francisco cityscape with a view of Sutro Tower"</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among other things, this gives us the option to specify post title without having to load a separate url.
      It can also be used to give standard relations (like <code>describedby</code>) more user friendly labels
      for display, like <code>description</code>. The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288">Web Linking</a>
      RFC includes a method for specifying different character sets and languages.
    </p>

    <h3>Example</h3>

    <p>
      In combination, these rules lend themselves well to managing day-resolution
      streams by hand. For instance, if you have a blog stored as a time stream,
      you could structure it like this:
    </p>

<pre>blog.timestream/
   2020/
     06/
        23/
          01-first-post.md
          01-first-post.md$self.attributes
          01-first-post.md$describedby.json
          01-first-post.md$describedby.json.attributes
          02-second-post-on-the-first-day.md
        24/
           01-third-post.md
</pre>

    <p>
      On the other end of the spectrum, if it's possible that multiple files
      are generated per second&mdash;and if the ordering within a single second is meaningful&mdash;then the store should generate names that sort properly. (<a href="https://github.com/ulid/spec"
      target="_blank">ulid</a> is a nice example of a name generation technique with the desired properties.)
    </p>

    <p>
      In that case, the directory structure might look something like this:
    </p>

<pre>posts.timestream/
2020/
 06/
    24/
       051121Z-01EBJBSPBA3BAMAHS9RQDDK83G.txt
       051121Z-01EBJBSPBA3BAMAHS9RQDDK83H.txt
       051121Z-01EBJBSPBA3BAMAHS9RQDDK83I.txt
</pre>
